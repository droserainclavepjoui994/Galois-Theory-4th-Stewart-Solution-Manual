  * * Author: Ian Stewart
   
  * Since 1973, Galois Theory has been educating undergraduate students on Galois groups and classical Galois theory. In Galois Theory, Fourth Edition, mathematician and popular science author Ian Stewart updates this well-established textbook for today’s algebra students.
 
  * New to the Fourth Edition
  * * The replacement of the topological proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra with a simple and plausible result from point-set topology and estimates that will be familiar to anyone who has taken a first course in analysis
    * * Revised chapter on ruler-and-compass constructions that results in a more elegant theory and simpler proofs
      * * A section on constructions using an angle-trisector since it is an intriguing and direct application of the methods developed
        * * A new chapter that takes a retrospective look at what Galois actually did compared to what many assume he did
          * * Updated references
